# Arduino Projects

These two are my first embedded projects to try out embedded programming. For these two proejcts I took advantage of the Arduino library and the LED Matrix that came with my starter kit.

## Text Displayer
### Overview
I wanted to recreate the scrolling text display often seen on public transport, which shows travel information. The starter kit I received included a library that helps me interact with each of the LEDs I used.

### Component(s) Required
- 1 x LED Matrix
- 5 x Male to Female jumper wires
### Demo

## Snake Game
### Overview
I felt that recreating snake on this is a must.

### Component(s) Required
- 1 x LED Matrix
- 9 x Male to Male jumper wires
- 5 x Male to Female jumper wires
- 4 x Push Switches
